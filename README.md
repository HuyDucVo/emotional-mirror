# Emotional Mirror Interface
 Every day, we use a mirror to comb our hair or makeup. However, the mirror is emotional-less. A lot of people feel discouraged or even don't want to look at the mirror. We all know appearance is very important, but confidence is more important. 


**Emotional Mirror Interface provides an interface to other applications like Google Voice, Siri, Youtube etc to advance the UX of the mirror while making their days better and better.**
